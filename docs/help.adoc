== NAME
xenon - A natively compiled programming language similar to C

== SYNOPSIS

xenon [_OPTIONS_]... _FILE_

== DESCRIPTION

The xenon(1) command converts Xenon Source file _FILE_ into NASM assembly, object files, or x64/x86 machine code.

== OPTIONS

=== Optimization Options

*-o__NAME__, --optimize=__NAME__::
  Enables the optimisation with the name __NAME__
*-ono__NAME__, --optimize=no__NAME__::
  Disable the optimization with the name __NAME__
*-O__N__, --optimization-level=__N__::
  Enables

|===
| Name | Description
| dead-code-elem | Eliminates dead code
| inline-macros  | Inlines functions marked as `@macro` and `@inline`. See below.
| reshuffle | Reshuffle expressions to be faster to execute.
| value-propagator | Eliminate useless variables by propagating their values across the code.
| flatten-typeless-blocks | Allows for much greater contextual optimization.
|===

`no` can be appended to the beginning of any of those names to explicitly remove it.
For example, `-ono-reshuffle`.
By default, they are all off. By doing `-O[n]` for any value `n > 0`, they are all enabled,
and can be explicitly removed if wanted. With `-O0`, no optimizations are applied, regardless
if they are specified in the command arguments.
This is designed to allow for optimizations that are disabled by default.


| `-O[n]`, `--optimization-level=[n]`| Enable optimization level `n`.
`n` must be an integer from 0 to 10 inclusive.
`-O0` is the default, and disables all optimization.
| `-v[name]`, `--verbose=[name]` | Enable the verbose output of `name`.

list of verbose options:

|===
| Flag | Description

| `-vend-timings` | Print how long it took to run and compile.
| `-vend-compile-timings` | Print how long each portion of the compiler took to run.
| `-voptimizations` | Print debug information about how each optimization was applied.
| `-vast` | Print both the non-optimized and optimized AST
| `-vdecompile-ast` | Print a decompiled AST
| `-vtokens` | Print the lexed tokens
| `-vpurity` | Print the purity of each defined function.
| `-vall`, `-vv` | Print all of the above.
| `-v` | Print a helpful subset of the above
