# Xenon, a Native C-Like Language

This language compiles to 64 bit x86 Assembly. It's similar to C,
along with a few extensions. Read the docs at https://mee42.github.io/Xenon/.

Note: This version was abandon in order to do a full rewrite. Was never fully polished. Code probably doesn't compile anymore
